<<<<<BASIC THEORY OF GITHUB:>>>>>



Repository = Directory for a project

Commit = saving a change (we can choose the commits to be on a particular branch)

History = lets us keep track of all the previous commits

Branches = can be a master aka the linear list of commits previously done or branch other than master

Pull = Merge usually occurs with pull, and what pull does is, it pulls the changes made onto a particular branch back onto the master branch(basically master branch pulls the changes onto it hence the term pull)

Fork = making a copy of someone else's repository and bringing it to my github account

Pull Request = while working on a forked repo we decide at some point in time that we want to merge the changes made on this forked repo into the repo where we forked it from. Hence a pull request is sent to the owner of that repo, in order to seek his permission to accept the changes to be made to the repo.




<<<<<COMMANDS IN GITHUB:>>>>>

1) git init
2) git clone <url of the repo to be cloned> //clones the specified url repo onto our local machine

**Now navigate into this cloned repo**

3) git status //gives us info about the branch we're on and also the status that whether it is modified by us or not

**Our machine needs to know who we are when we make git changes**

4) git config --global user.name <our username>
   git config --global user.email <our email of the github account>

5) git config --list //check whether step 4 worked
6) git commit -a -m <"message regarding the commit"> //save these changes. (-a means all the changes)
7) git log <any number with a dash before it> //this command allows us to see locally the history of the commits that have been made
8) git remote //to know where to actually push the changes made
9) git push <result of git remote> <branch name>
