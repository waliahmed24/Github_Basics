<<TURNING A LOCALLY EXISTING PROJECT DIRECTORY INTO A GITHUB REPOSITORY>>

(1) cd into the directory you want to turn into a git repo

(2) git init //initilizes an empty git repo

(3) git add <file name> //for commiting to be done onto specific files. The files selected go into a staging area and then get commited into the github repo later on as soon as we type git commit. We can also remove a file once staged by: git rm --cached <file name>

(4) git commit -m <"message regarding the commit">

(5) go to github and make a new repo. To be able to associate a remote with it.

(6) git remote add origin <URL of the repo on github>

(7) git push origin master //push the changes onto the github repo

(8) git pull origin master //pull any changes made on the github repo locally onto my computer's repo
